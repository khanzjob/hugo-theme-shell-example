### Project 2: Cybersecurity Solution

**Description**: Developed an integrated system for threat intelligence sharing, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of cybersecurity management. The system integrates Flask, MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), and a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

**Technologies Used**: 
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Security Tools**: MISP, SIEM

**Outcome**: The solution has been implemented by several organizations to enhance their cybersecurity posture. It has enabled faster detection and response to threats, reducing the risk of cyber incidents.

### Project 3: Parental Control App

**Description**: Developed a mobile application designed to help parents monitor and control their children's phone usage. The app includes features such as screen time management, app usage tracking, and content filtering.

**Technologies Used**: 
- **Mobile Development**: Flutter, Dart
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

**Outcome**: The app has been downloaded over 10,000 times and has received positive reviews for its user-friendly interface and robust feature set. It has helped many parents ensure their children's digital safety and wellbeing.


### Project 4: Network Intrusion Detection System

**Description**: For my final year project, I developed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance network security. The IDS uses machine learning algorithms to detect and alert on suspicious network activity.

**Technologies Used**: 
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Networking Tools**: Wireshark, Snort

**Outcome**: The IDS successfully detected various types of network intrusions with high accuracy. The project received high praise from my professors and peers, and I plan to continue refining it for potential real-world deployment.
